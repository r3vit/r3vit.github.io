<h2 id="wtf-is-stable-diffusion">WTF is Stable Diffusion</h2>
<p>Last year there was the Perfect Storm: the common use of a technology called <a href="https://ai.googleblog.com/2017/08/transformer-novel-neural-network.html">transformers</a> + the <a href="http://mediangroup.org/gpu.html">availability of gpu power</a> + the release to the public as <a href="https://github.com/CompVis/stable-diffusion">open source software</a>.</p>
<p>From OpenAI with its <a href="https://openai.com/dall-e-2/">Dalle-2</a> to <a href="https://midjourney.com">Midjourney</a> and Stability AI open source version of <a href="https://stability.ai">Stable Diffusion</a>, that generated a positive euphoria which brought to the <strong>tremendous growing of AI tools for image generation</strong>.</p>
<p>In particular, Stable Diffusion is the one that was one open sourced and the community started to grow rapidly.</p>
<p>I will not describe how technically works because there are a lot of resources on the web.</p>
<p>If you want a more detailed description, read <a href="https://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-stable-diffusion/">this awesome blogpost</a>. It explains very well what is and how it works!</p>
<h2 id="the-problem-with-the-style">The problem with the &ldquo;style&rdquo;</h2>
<p>As seen in the last blog post, the <strong>style</strong> of the stained glass window is really hard to manage.</p>
<p>Some results seems to be ok, some others are more like mosaics, and others photorealist representations of people.</p>
<p>If you want to create some coherent visualization, based on your idea and an already existent style of a stained glass window, you really need some custom work to do.</p>
<p>Luckily last year the contributions to the Stable Diffusion software came also from top notch scientists all over the world. Google developed its method called <a href="https://dreambooth.github.io">Dreambooth</a> for custom train/style transfer model into our image generator tool.</p>
<p>This studies (that are then extended to the software) allows to choose, select and transfer an image style (or add a new photo) to be used and syntetized into the newly generated image.</p>
<h2 id="our-goal">Our goal</h2>
<p>Our goal is to generate some stained glass windows using a specific drawing style.
I&rsquo;ll choose this beautiful <a href="https://www.artstation.com/artwork/e0dvBD">Artwork Style</a> by  <a href="https://www.artstation.com/ranefea">Ranefea</a>.</p>
<p>Here some example:</p>
<figure><img src="images/sglass_0.jpg" width="60%"/><figcaption>
            <h4>Link standing the ground</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<hr>
<figure><img src="images/sglass_1.png" width="60%"/><figcaption>
            <h4>Princess Zelda</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<hr>
<figure><img src="images/sglass_2.jpg" width="60%"/><figcaption>
            <h4>Link with elements</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<hr>
<p>Spoiler: yes, as beginner in the stained glass worls i know that this drawings cannot be <em>realistically</em> translated into real stained glass windows. Just take this as what it is: an experiment on style transfer for this images. Then if you want to create your design in real world, you will have to fix the template.</p>
<h2 id="lets-try-it">Let&rsquo;s try it!</h2>
<p>I will not describe each step. If you need help, follow <a href="https://bytexd.com/how-to-use-dreambooth-to-fine-tune-stable-diffusion-colab/">this very extensive tutorial</a>.</p>
<p>Just some tips and suggestions:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you have not a good GPU, use Google Colab. It&rsquo;s really easy and comes with working GPU.</li>
<li>Create a new Google Account. It will take some GB of space to download the existent model and create your own.</li>
<li>Download 10-12 images with the style you are recreating and use &ldquo;number of images * 100&rdquo; steps for better results. You&rsquo;ll understand when you find out about it.</li>
</ul>
<p>After the installation of the software using this <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/TheLastBen/fast-stable-diffusion/blob/main/fast-DreamBooth.ipynb">Python Notebook</a>) I&rsquo;ll just need to add these images to my Google Drive, create an <a href="https://huggingface.co">HuggingFace</a> account and run step by step the notebook.</p>
<p>Be sure to select the <strong>&ldquo;style transfer&rdquo;</strong> option!</p>
<p>You need to give your model a name. I&rsquo;ll call it &ldquo;sglass&rdquo; (stained glass) style.</p>
<p>After 15 to 20 minutes the trained model is ready, we can start generating our images!</p>
<h2 id="results-for-my-new-sglass-style-model">Results for my new &ldquo;sglass style model&rdquo;</h2>
<p><strong>Prompt text:</strong> <em>‚Äúcat, sglass style‚Äù</em></p>
<p><strong>Results:</strong></p>
<figure><img src="images/result-cat.png" width="60%"/><figcaption>
            <h4>Cat, sglass style</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p><strong>Prompt text:</strong> <em>&ldquo;frodo baggings, sglass style‚Äù</em></p>
<p><strong>Results:</strong></p>
<figure><img src="images/result-frodo.png" width="60%"/><figcaption>
            <h4>frodo baggings, sglass style</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<hr>
<p><strong>Prompt text:</strong> <em>&ldquo;girl with red hair, sglass style‚Äù</em></p>
<p><strong>Results:</strong></p>
<figure><img src="images/result-girl.png" width="60%"/><figcaption>
            <h4>girl with red hair, sglass style</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<hr>
<p><strong>Prompt text:</strong> <em>&ldquo;a brown bear in a forest, sglass style‚Äù</em></p>
<p><strong>Results:</strong></p>
<figure><img src="images/result-bear.png" width="60%"/><figcaption>
            <h4>a brown bear in a forest, sglass style</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
<p>As you can see, the results are pretty interesting!</p>
<p>I know, i know. It&rsquo;s not good enought for zero-work and for sure not perfect for a staind glass window.</p>
<p>This experiment was done in a bored afternoon after going to buy some glass sheets.</p>
<p>I need a software that can help me dream of new stained glass designs (that probably will never recreate on a window because it need a lot more of an afternoon), and gives me also ideas for smaller stained glass works to do.</p>
<p>Given an idea and a style, this can be a first step in that direction.</p>
<p>Also, I did this because it&rsquo;s funny. Isn&rsquo;t that a very good reason to try out and experiment?</p>
