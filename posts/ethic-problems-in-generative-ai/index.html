<h3 id="what-is-ethics">What is ethics?</h3>

            <h4>The difference between good and bad, Lexica.art</h4>

<p>Ethics is the branch of philosophy that deals with moral principles and values.</p>
<p>It involves the study of what is right and wrong, good and bad, and how people ought to behave.</p>
<p>The main branch that works in this type of problems is <strong>applied ethics</strong>, which deals with the practical application of ethical theory to real-world issues.</p>
<p>As you grow up, you probably will make more decisions on your own and may be faced with more complex ethical dilemmas. Ethics can help you navigate these situations by providing a framework for thinking about how to act in a morally responsible way. It can help you to understand different perspectives, weigh the pros and cons of different actions and make a decision that aligns with your values.</p>
<p>As end note, ethics is not only about following rules or laws, but also about thinking critically and making informed decisions. It&rsquo;s about being a responsible and accountable person in the society.</p>
<h3 id="the-exploit-of-others-work">The exploit of others work</h3>

<p>In generative AI, the model that will create a new text, a new image or writes a piece of code must be traind on a huge (or sometimes just a bunch of images, as seen in the <a href="https://r3vit.github.io/posts/generating-stained-glass-windows-with-a-custom-style-in-stable-diffusion/">&ldquo;stained glass style&rdquo; post</a>) collection of examples in order to learn the &ldquo;right way to do things&rdquo;.</p>
<p>In my experiments it&rsquo;s just a dozen of images used for personal exploration and no models or codes were shared with anyone. It&rsquo;s just an excuse to do some unethical things? Hope not. But if you know the answer, please let me know.</p>
<p>The first ethical problem in this post is about the exploit of other people work and ownership.</p>
<p>When images are used to train generative AI models, the resulting art may be considered a derivative work, which raises questions about who should own the rights to the resulting art.</p>
<p>This can be especially problematic if the original images were used without the consent of the individuals depicted, as they may not have intended to be part of the art-making process.</p>
<p>Finally, the use of other people&rsquo;s images (and works) in generative AI can also perpetuate power imbalances and inequalities, as the individuals depicted may not have the same level of control over how their images are used.</p>
<p>And the use of them, as innocent it can be, it&rsquo;s ethic?</p>
<p>And if today I&rsquo;ll train a new model, based only on generated images from another model, after how many steps the problem can be considered &ldquo;solved&rdquo;? Never?</p>
<h3 id="the-creation-of-irrealistic-reality-and-bias">The creation of irrealistic reality and bias</h3>
<figure><img src="images/irrealistic.jpeg" width="60%"/><figcaption>
            <h4>Dantion Marble Statues Hypernetwork model</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>What if I&rsquo;m a marble sculptor and all of my committers wants a &ldquo;pixel perfect&rdquo; statue?</p>
<p>What about a painting? Or a stained glass window? It&rsquo;s my imperfect work a complete failure compared to these expectations?</p>
<p>It works for fashion (with unrealistic bodies), will not work for other things?</p>
<p>For example in fashion, the unrealistic body types can be considered an ethical problem because it perpetuates unrealistic and unhealthy beauty standards that can lead to a negative impact on individuals body image, especially for those who do not conform to these standards.</p>
<p>It is also a problem because it does not represents the diversity of the society.</p>
<p>Generative AI models can perpetuate and even amplify societal biases that are present in the data used to train them. For example, a model trained on a dataset of mostly white faces may have difficulty recognizing or generating faces of other races. This can lead to discrimination and unfair treatment of certain groups of people.</p>
<p>Can this happened also in iper specialized models for art works?</p>
<h3 id="exploitation-of-real-people">Exploitation of real people</h3>
<p>This is a model for <a href="https://civitai.com/models/1237/jenna-ortega">Jenna Ortega</a>.</p>
<p>This is a major problem.</p>
<p>One of the main issues is the exploitation of individuals&rsquo; privacy and photos.</p>
<p>When images of people are used in generative AI without their consent, it can be a violation of their personal privacy and autonomy. This is especially concerning if the images are used in ways that could be damaging to the individuals depicted, such as creating deepfakes or training models that perpetuate stereotypes.</p>
<p>Is this a real problem also if done with the consent of the subject?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not illegal (for now), and that&rsquo;s why we should talk more about the ethics in this topic.</p>
<h3 id="what-can-we-do">What can we do?</h3>
<p>I used only Artwork/images examples, but the questions are also valid for text or other generative forms (sounds? videos?)</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s important to approach the use of other people&rsquo;s images in generative AI with a critical and ethical mindset, seeking consent from the individuals depicted and being transparent about the use of their images.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also a main point to respect the rights of the individuals depicted and to consider the potential impact on their privacy, authorship, and ownership.</p>
<p>Here some examples on how we can address these problems:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Transparency</strong>: Making the decision-making process of AI systems transparent and understandable to humans can help identify and address any ethical issues that may arise.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Bias correction</strong>: AI systems are often trained on data that is biased, which can lead to ethical issues. Ensuring that the data used to train AI systems is unbiased and diverse can help mitigate these issues.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Explainabilit</strong>y: AI systems should be able to explain their decision-making process in a way that is understandable to humans. This can help identify and address ethical issues that may arise.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Human oversight</strong>: AI systems should be designed with human oversight to ensure that they are behaving ethically. This can include built-in safety mechanisms that allow humans to intervene if necessary.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Last but most important is to have <strong>Ethical guidelines</strong>: Developing and adhering to ethical guidelines for AI development and use can help ensure that AI systems are behaving ethically and addressing any ethical issues that may arise.</p>
</li>
</ol>
