      <description>r3v.it refactoring Hello world!
This is only an example of blog post for website refactoring.
In this website I&amp;rsquo;ll put writings about things that I like and love.
You will not find the answers of you most deep questions, the the &amp;ldquo;best resources&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;exciting posts&amp;rdquo;.
Just some thoughts and hopes.
It&amp;rsquo;s not perfect, but it&amp;rsquo;s mine.
 This is my brain
And it&amp;rsquo;s fine
It&amp;rsquo;s where I spend a vast majority of my time</description>
