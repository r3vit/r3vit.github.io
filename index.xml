      <description>Pause One post per week.
Exploring new things (AI), funny things (card and game generation), serious things (software archiecture) and things I recently falled in love (glass).
Good intentions for the new year lasted 3 weeks :)
This post it&amp;rsquo;s more like an apology than a real update.
People First Something that I wrote (and how I wrote it) hurted people that I care a lot about. I removed the posts for now.</description>

      <description>Quasi estranei game It was Thursday evening when discovered from the web this card game:
WE ARE NOT REALLY STRANGERS
What&amp;rsquo;s the purpose of that game?
From their official website:
We&amp;rsquo;re Not Really Strangers is a purpose driven card game and movement all about empowering meaningful connections. Three carefully crafted levels of questions and wildcards that allow you to deepen your existing relationships and create new ones.
Seems interesting! How it&amp;rsquo;s made?</description>

      <description>r3v.it refactoring Hello world!
This is only an example of blog post for website refactoring.
In this website I&amp;rsquo;ll put writings about things that I like and love.
You will not find the answers of you most deep questions, the the &amp;ldquo;best resources&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;exciting posts&amp;rdquo;.
Just some thoughts and hopes.
It&amp;rsquo;s not perfect, but it&amp;rsquo;s mine.
 This is my brain
And it&amp;rsquo;s fine
It&amp;rsquo;s where I spend a vast majority of my time</description>
